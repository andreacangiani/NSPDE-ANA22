Lecturer: Andrea Cangiani andrea.cangiani@sissa.it

Course Type: SISSA PhD Course and MSc Data Science and Scientific Computing

Academic Year: 2021-2022

Period: march - may

Research Group: Mathematical Analysis, Modelling, and Applications mathLab

Description:
This course provides a high level overview on the numerical solution of partial differential equations. All major classes of numerical methods will be analysed within a rigorous mathematical setting. Key aspects, such as consistency and stability, will be thoroughly investigated, providing the guidelines for the correct choice and implementation of numerical methods for a range of problems. The lectures will be completed by a series of guided problems for testing in practice the numerical algorithms and their properties, helping everyone to build their own suits of simulation codes.
